## Restaurant Management System — C# and SQL Server

The Restaurant Management System is a full-featured, server-driven application built using C# (ASP.NET Web Forms) and SQL Server.
The project simulates core restaurant operations such as menu display, order handling, notification management, and customer communication — all implemented using Web Forms controls without manually writing HTML.

This system demonstrates backend development skills, database integration, and complete workflow management in a classic enterprise-style ASP.NET Web Forms environment.


## Project Overview

The application is built using ASP.NET Web Forms with structured page flow, server controls, and backend logic written in C#.
It connects directly to SQL Server to manage data operations such as creating orders, updating menu items, tracking notifications, and handling customer interactions.

## Key Features

Several improvements can expand the Restaurant Management System into a more advanced, production-ready application. Planned enhancements include:
##  • Role-Based Authentication
Adding separate dashboards for admins, chefs, cashiers, and customers with controlled access permissions.
##  • Real-Time Order Tracking
Implementing live order status updates using SignalR or a similar real-time communication system.
 ## • Enhanced Menu Management
Allowing admins to upload images, adjust availability, manage categories, and set daily offers.
 ## • Customer Portal
Creating a customer-facing interface where users can track their orders, re-order items, and leave feedback.
 ## • Payment Gateway Integration
Supporting secure online payments through third-party services for dine-in, takeaway, or delivery orders.
##  • Analytics Dashboard
Adding visual reports for sales, most ordered items, peak hours, and overall restaurant performance.
##  • Order Notifications for Staff
Generating automated notifications for kitchen staff when new orders are placed.
##  • Inventory Management System
Tracking stock levels, updating usage automatically based on orders, and generating low-stock alerts.
##  • Multi-Language Support
Offering both English and Arabic interfaces for a wider audience.
##  • Migration to Modern ASP.NET Core
Rebuilding the application with MVC or Razor Pages for improved performance, scalability, and modern architecture.
