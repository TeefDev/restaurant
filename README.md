## Restaurant Management System — C# and SQL Server

The Restaurant Management System is a full-featured, server-driven application built using C# (ASP.NET Web Forms) and SQL Server.
The project simulates core restaurant operations such as menu display, order handling, notification management, and customer communication — all implemented using Web Forms controls without manually writing HTML.

This system demonstrates backend development skills, database integration, and complete workflow management in a classic enterprise-style ASP.NET Web Forms environment.


## Project Overview

The application is built using ASP.NET Web Forms with structured page flow, server controls, and backend logic written in C#.
It connects directly to SQL Server to manage data operations such as creating orders, updating menu items, tracking notifications, and handling customer interactions.
